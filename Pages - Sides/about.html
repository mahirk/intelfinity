            <section>History: </section>
            <p>Intelfinity was started in the summer of 2010 in Mumbai, India. After shifting around the name several times, a final decision was made to name it Intelfinty. 'Intel' - short for intelligence and '(In)finity' - short for infinity is meant to show there no limit as to the amount of intelligence that anything can have, there is always something more to fill a gap. This intelligent infinity is what we want our custmers to lean towards, whether it is a website revamp/launch to help increase sales and search engine optimization, create software plugins for NGOs in India to increase the speed of donation collections and reciepts or simply free-of-cost consulting on technology. The website and all the services was launched officially in Summer 2011, however the projects were usually personal or tilting towards education. Two key moments after launch were when Intelfinity, as a company helped educate teachers in IT, and Summer 2013 when we earned our first pay for the redesign of FLC. As a company, they are interested towards the IoT or the Internet of Things Concept. This is the kind of products they lean towards and experiment on at a daily basis.  </p><br>
